# libft

This is the first UNIT Factory (42 school) project.
Libft is an individual project at UNIT Factory (42 school) that requires us to re-create some standard C library functions including some additional ones that can be used later to build a library of useful functions for the rest of the program.

UNIT Factory (42 school) makes us reinventing the wheel just so we can have a deeper understanding of data structures and basic algorithms.
At 42 we're not allowed to use some standard libraries on our projects, so we have to keep growing this library with our own functions as we go farther in the program.

# What's inside?

1. **Libc Functions**: Some of the standard C functions
2. **Additional functions**: Functions UNIT Factory deems will be useful for later projects
3. **Bonus Functions**: Functions UNIT Factory deems will be useful for linked list manipulation
4. **Personal Functions**: My aditional functions.

# Usage
```
git clone https://github.com/kmieshko/libft.git
cd libft
make
```
You will get *libft.a*

Then you can compile your project added *libft.a* or just include the header *libft.h* to your project
